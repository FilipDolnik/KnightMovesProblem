# KnightMovesProblem

Solution to a problem of finding the smallest number of moves it takes a chess knight to move from one square to another. The chessboard is considered to be infinite so x and y coordinates of squares can be arbitrarily large or negative. The target square for the knight is [0, 0] but this can be easily changed by offsetting the input parameters.
